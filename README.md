## About me
Hi! My name is Josh, I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at Purdue University pursuing a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science. I'm currently interested in graduate studies in pure mathematics with a (tentative) focus in commutative algebra, and I have a wide range of knowledge, skills, and interests that help me quickly absorb new and abstract ideas and identify creative solutions to unique problems.
